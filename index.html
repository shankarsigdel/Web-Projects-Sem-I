<p><b>The Adventurous Experience of my Life:</b></p>
<p><p align='justify'>&quot;I am originally from Nepal. There are lots of Places to go for trekking. Among them,
I have visited <b>Gosainkunda.</b> Gosainkunda is a religious as well as tourist area
which is rich for its scenic beauty and magnificent mountain views.It is one of the
best and famous trekking destinations of the world.I have visited this place takking
5 days of treak.It gives glimpse into the diverse landscape, culture, and nature of Nepal.
Gosaikunda has a lake At an altitude of 4380m,the Gosaikunda lake is a sacred place for
both the Hindus and Buddhists. In that 5-days of trek i got perfect satisfaction from the
scenic beauty of nature.It allows us to experience high altitude trek within a short duration.
The trek period provides spectacular views of the snow-capped mountain peaks.The trek takes
through beautiful, lush green forests of rhododendron, oak, pine, and birch. If you have a
plan to have a treak and visit somebeautiful places, i suggest you to visit Nepal in general
and Gosainkunda in Particular&quot;</p>
